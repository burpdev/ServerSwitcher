# ServerSwitcher
 A very simple CoopNet server switcher for SM64EXCoop and SM64CoopDX!

The implementation is not very good, but it works given the situation.
If more alt CoopNet servers pop up, I'll make it more customizable to be able to easily add new ones from the user.
I might also pretty up the UI so it's not a complete eyesore.

This project uses [.NET 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.32-windows-x64-installer) and Winforms.

Feel free to modify and use this in any way!
